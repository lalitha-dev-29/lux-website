# Lalitha Manogna Kasturi — Portfolio

Personal luxury-marketing portfolio site: case studies, journal, learning, and an interactive world atlas.

Built with [Astro](https://astro.build) — static output, near-zero client JS, content managed as Markdown.

## Project structure

```
src/
  components/     Reusable UI: Nav, Footer, cards, the atlas map, the connect form
  content/        Markdown content collections
    case-studies/ One .md file per case study (frontmatter: title, tags, excerpt, pdfUrl, ...)
    journal/      One .md file per LinkedIn post preview
    certifications/  One .md file per certification (empty until you add real ones)
  content.config.ts  Schema for the collections above
  data/atlas.ts   Country descriptions + marker coordinates for the Atlas page
  layouts/        Shared page shell (Layout.astro)
  pages/          Routes — one file/folder per URL
  scripts/site.ts Nav scroll state, mobile menu, scroll-reveal animation
  styles/global.css  Design tokens + all component styles
legacy/index.html  The original single-file HTML/CSS/JS version, kept for reference
```

## Adding content

- **Case study**: add a new `.md` file to `src/content/case-studies/`, following the frontmatter shape of an existing one. It automatically appears in the grid and gets its own page at `/case-studies/<filename>/`.
- **Journal post**: add a `.md` file to `src/content/journal/` with `title`, `excerpt`, and the LinkedIn post `url`.
- **Certification**: add a `.md` file to `src/content/certifications/` once you have a real one to list.

## Commands

| Command           | Action                                      |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`       | Install dependencies                         |
| `npm run dev`       | Start the local dev server                   |
| `npm run build`     | Build the static site to `./dist/`           |
| `npm run preview`   | Preview the production build locally         |

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

A workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds and deploys on every push to `main`. In the repo's **Settings → Pages**, set the source to **GitHub Actions**.

The workflow derives the site's base path from the repo name automatically. If this repo is a `<username>.github.io` user/org site (served from the domain root), edit the workflow and drop the `BASE_PATH` override.
